# jekyll-layouts

## Overview
Layouts I'm using across multiple projects for jekyll based pages.

## Usage

### projects.html
A single page layout that I use for GitHub project pages. It needs the
following configuration attributes in `_config.yml`:
```
gaugesid: the id for the gauges site to track
projecturl: the URL of your project on GitHub
basesite: URL of the site to get CSS from
```
